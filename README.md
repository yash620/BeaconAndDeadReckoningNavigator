# Beacon Waypointing + Dead Reackoning

This adds beacon waypointing functionality to the [DeadReckoning](https://github.com/nisargnp/DeadReckoning) application developed by Nisarg Patel. The main functionality is within the beaconlocalization package which provides a library to scan to beacons while also processing data files associated with the waypointing. For a sample data file that has the expected JSON structure please look at data.json.
